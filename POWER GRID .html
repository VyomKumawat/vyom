      blackouts About 2:35 a.m on 30 July 2012, the Northern Region Grid, which
      provides power to nine states in northern India including Delhi,
      experienced a widespread outage due to a grid disturbance. Power Grid and
      POSOCO began work immediately to restore power.</li><br><li> By 8:00 a.m. essential
      services had been restored, with 60 percent of the normal Northern Region
      Grid load restored by 11:00 a.m. Power supply was then restored
      progressively and by 12:30 p.m. power was extended to most of the cities
      and towns through Power Grid substations.</li><br><li>The Northern Region Grid was
      brought back to normalcy to meet the demand of about 30 GW at 7:00 p.m. On
      31 July 2012, the Northern Region Grid collapsed a second time, hours
      after the power supply had been restored to the northern region following
      the previous day's disruption.</li><br><</li> Eastern transmission lines also failed,
      disrupting power supply in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, West Bengal,
      Assam and Punjab, among other states.[11]</li><br><li> After the power failures,
      then-Power Minister Veerappa Moily said that transmission grids would be
      independently audited in three months to ensure that the grids were
      fail-safe.[12] PowerGrid InvIT initial public offering In late April 2021,
